# Outside-In TDD

Turns an **approved** scenario into working software. Start from observable behavior at the
application boundary, get trustworthy failure first, then let design emerge from failing tests.

**Core rule:** real domain objects, mocked external boundaries, fast in-memory tests.
**Hard rule:** no implementation code before RED is a clean behavior failure.

## Entry Gate — read before anything else

This skill never decides what the expected result should be.

Before entering any phase below, confirm the behaviour has an approved observable outcome — a
Gherkin scenario, a worked example, an agreed expected value. When it does not:

- **Stop.** No test, no implementation, no provisional choice of outcome on the business's behalf.
- Name the decision that is still open, and ask for one observable example that closes it.
- `bdd-methodology` owns that conversation. Re-enter here once it has an answer.

An unapproved outcome driven out through a clean cycle still yields a suite that proves only that
the code matches a guess.

## What this skill owns

It owns **SEQUENCE**: what must be true before the next phase may start, and what evidence proves
it, **and which production layer a business rule's code lands in**. Everything else is delegated
— load the owner rather than re-deriving its rules here.

| Question | Owner |
|---|---|
| What the observable behaviour IS, and whether it is approved | `bdd-methodology` |
| Which test project, which **test** layer, which double | `clean-architecture-testing` |
| Whether a domain test is authorized; coverage matrix; walking-skeleton strategy A–D | `test-design-mandates` |
| Mutation score, survivor classification, report parsing | `mutation-testing` |
| Commit-time self-check | `craft-discipline` |
| Cleaning up test code that already passes | `test-refactoring-catalog` |
| **Phase order, entry evidence, the outer→inner handoff, and which production layer a rule's code lands in** | **this skill** |

A loading agent descriptor owns **MODE** — interactivity, thresholds, and what its dispatch payload
carries. Where the two disagree, **the descriptor wins on mode and this skill wins on sequence.** A
rule here that names a mode (pause and ask, a mutation percentage, how big one increment is)
describes the common case; it does not override the descriptor that loads it.

## Double-Loop TDD

- **Outer loop** — acceptance test (customer view). Stays RED while the inner loop cycles.
- **Inner loop** — unit tests (developer view). RED → GREEN in minutes.

Outer drives **WHAT** to build, inner drives **HOW**. Never build a class not required by an active
scenario.

The inner cycle is **2 steps, not 3**: RED (behavior failure) → SYNTHESIZE GREEN (clean synthesis).
There is no dirty-then-refactor step.

## The 4-Phase Cycle (per behavior slice)

### 1. PREPARE

Identify the **input boundary** (use case / interactor the test enters through) and the **output
boundaries** (gateways the test observes: repositories, presenters, external services). Target
exactly ONE scenario.

*Boundary-to-Boundary Testing* below defines what counts as a boundary at each test level, and what
must never be tested directly. `clean-architecture-testing` maps each level to its project and
doubles.

### 2. RED (behavior failure only)

Write the failing test. Run it.

- Compilation errors = **wishful thinking phase** → implement stubs/empty returns to compile, rerun
- Assertion/behavior failure = **RED** ✓ → proceed to the architectural checkpoint
- Never treat compilation errors as RED. "I know it will fail" is not RED either — run it.

**Programming by Wishful Thinking:** when your test won't compile, you're discovering the API you
need. Stub just enough to compile, then confirm the test fails on behavior.

#### Placeholder assertions are NOT wishful thinking

Any assertion designed to fail unconditionally makes the test compile and fail, but asserts
**nothing** about the API under test. It produces false RED evidence, in every language.
`craft-discipline` C5 enumerates them; `throw new NotImplementedException()` is the one that
matters here, because it is the most tempting way to satisfy step 2 below.

A proper wishful-thinking test calls the function you WISH existed and lets the build or runtime
surface the failure naturally:

1. Reference the missing type/function → compile error or missing-symbol/module error
2. Stub just enough to compile (empty return / minimal implementation) → test fails on the real business assertion

NEVER insert a placeholder assertion, including as the stub in step 2. `craft-discipline` C5 owns
the list and enforces it at commit time.

### Between RED and GREEN: Architectural Guidance (MANDATORY)

**Hard rule:** this checkpoint is not skippable. Do not proceed to SYNTHESIZE GREEN without it.

**The invariant:** the failing test is inspected — by someone other than whoever is about to write
the implementation — before any production code exists. What is inspected is the RED output itself,
never a promise that it exists.

**Who inspects, and how, is MODE.** In an interactive session the developer reviews and explicitly
validates the test before you continue. Under an autonomous dispatch the inspection belongs to the
orchestrator and happens between two separate dispatches (see *When Orchestrating Subagents*): a
subagent instructed to act autonomously does not satisfy this by asking anyway — it reports the
failing test and stops there. Either way, no implementation is written until the inspection happened.

Orient design before synthesis: which pattern (specification, factory, builder), which layer owns
the logic, immutability and return values vs mutations.

**Name the owner in writing, before the implementation is written.** State the type that will hold
the rule and the layer it lives in, then check that answer against *When to Write Which* below.
"The use case computes it" is valid only for orchestration or a simple rule.

### 3. SYNTHESIZE-GREEN (clean synthesis)

Implement the smallest slice the failing test demands — and implement it clean the first time.

**"Clean synthesis" constrains the QUALITY of the first draft, not its SCOPE.** Complete means
complete for THIS test: no speculative branches, no unrequested error handling, no abstraction the
test does not force. Gold-plating here contradicts the Walking Skeleton rule and is what a
descriptor means by "minimal production code".

- Follows all architectural rules and coding standards — idiomatic, domain semantics, SOLID
- No dirty-then-refactor — synthesize properly from the start
- If the test was misunderstood → revise the test, restart from RED

**No iteration after SYNTHESIZE GREEN** unless RED was wrong or architectural guidance changed.
Refining code instead of revising RED means you are back in 3-step TDD — stop and restart.

### 4. COMMIT & VERIFY

- Run the **Post-GREEN Wiring Verification** below to detect Fixture Theater.
- Run the **Coverage and Mutation Gate** below.
- Commit. The message format is `craft-discipline` C9. **Never commit on red.**

## Quick Reference

| Phase | What | Success Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| **PREPARE** | Name the input and output boundaries, pick ONE scenario | The scenario under test is unambiguous |
| **RED** | Write test, stub until it compiles, run | Test fails on **behavior** (assertion), not compilation |
| **Guidance** (**MANDATORY**) | Orient the approach, **name the type and layer that will own the rule**, + **the failing test is inspected** | Owning type and layer stated before the implementation is written, the RED output has been seen by someone other than its implementer |
| **SYNTHESIZE GREEN** | Synthesize the smallest slice the test demands, clean the first time | Tests green, architecture respected, nothing built the test did not force |
| **COMMIT & VERIFY** | Wiring verification, mutation gate, commit | Production files in the diff, mutation gate run and its survivors resolved, never on red |

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|---|---|
| "Compilation error IS red" | No. Compilation = wishful thinking. RED = behavior failure. |
| "I'll write dirty code then refactor" | That's 3-step TDD. SYNTHESIZE GREEN produces clean code. |
| "I can skip RED, I know it'll fail" | Run it. RED proves your test catches real failures. |
| "The placeholder fails, so it's RED" | No. A placeholder asserts nothing about the API (`craft-discipline` C5). Write the real call; let the missing symbol cause a compile error, then stub past it. |
| "All the tests pass, so the design is fine" | Green proves behavior, never placement. A tier table living in the handler passes every test and is still in the wrong layer. |

## Red Flags — STOP and Restart

- Entering the cycle at all while the expected result is still an open business decision
- Implementation code before RED is a behavior failure
- Compilation errors treated as RED
- Placeholder assertion in the test body — tests no behavior, produces false RED evidence
- Skipping RED entirely
- Skipping the architectural guidance checkpoint
- Proceeding to SYNTHESIZE GREEN before the failing test was inspected
- Refining code after SYNTHESIZE GREEN instead of revising RED

**Any of these mean:** Delete the code, start over with a proper RED.

## Iron Rule of Tests

NEVER modify a failing test to make it pass — fix the implementation.
If stuck after **3 attempts**: revert to last green, escalate.

A test modified to turn green is theater: it no longer witnesses behavior.

## Boundary-to-Boundary Testing (all test levels)

Every test enters through an **input boundary** (use case / interactor) and asserts at **output boundaries** (gateways) or on the return value. Internal classes (entities, value objects, domain services) are exercised **indirectly** — never instantiated directly in test code.

| Test level | Input boundary | Output observation |
|---|---|---|
| Acceptance | Use case / interactor (application handler) | Gateway mocked (repository, email…) or use-case output DTO |
| Unit (domain function) | The public function signature (its contract IS the boundary) | Return value |
| Integration (gateway adapter) | Gateway contract | Real infrastructure (DB, filesystem, subprocess) |

**Unit tests are NOT "isolated object tests."** They are boundary-to-boundary at a smaller scope. Testing a pure domain function by calling it directly IS boundary-to-boundary — the function's public signature is the contract under test.

**Do not test directly:** basic constructors (unless they enforce complex invariants), simple
getters/setters, or DTOs and passive data structures. Simple value objects are covered by their use
in policies and orchestrators.

## When to Write Which

Every row answers two questions. Answering only the test question is how a rule ends up living in
an orchestrator.

| Signal | Code lives in | Test that covers it |
|---|---|---|
| Orchestration (load/save/publish, no rule) | Application use case / handler | Use Case test (Acceptance) |
| Simple rule: one condition, no edge-case matrix | Application use case / handler | Already covered by primary Use Case test |
| Rule over an aggregate's own state | Method on the Domain entity / aggregate | Use Case test (Acceptance) |
| Complex invariants, large edge-case matrices, or reused rules | A NEW named type in the Domain project (`architecture-patterns` picks Policy vs Domain Service vs Specification) | Use Case test (Acceptance); add a Domain test only if `test-design-mandates` Mandate 4 opens a gate |

**"Complex" is not a judgement call:** tiers or bands, a cap or a floor, rounding, or three or more
worked examples of one calculation put you on the last row. Classify the whole approved rule as the
feature states it, not the delta of the slice you are on.

**Whichever row you land on, the handler holds no arithmetic and no branch of the rule** beyond the
simple-rule row: it passes the inputs to the Domain type and returns what comes back. A Domain type
that carries the tier rate while the handler keeps the bands and the cap is the same failure, half
done. Placement never depends on whether a Domain test is authorized: an unauthorized Domain test
means the Use Case test covers the type, never that the rule moves back into the handler.

**Default:** Start with a Use Case test. Add Domain tests only if extracting a complex rule makes testing simpler.

Placement is not permission to design upfront: the Domain type still appears only when a failing
test demands it (Step 2). When a rule has meaningful edge-case combinations, cover those
combinations explicitly in Domain tests.

## Outside-In Approach

**Prerequisite:** Gherkin scenarios written and approved before this skill applies — for new
features, bug fixes, and behavior-changing refactoring. `bdd-methodology` defines WHAT the
observable behavior is; this skill turns it into working software.

### Step 1: Map Scenario to Acceptance Test

Translate the scenario to a top-level acceptance-style test entering at the Application boundary.
Mock only external boundaries; use real domain objects.

### Step 2: Let Domain Emerge

**STOP. Do NOT create any domain class, value object, entity, policy, or enum before your first test
fails to compile.** Design MUST emerge from red — not from upfront thinking. Even if you already know
the domain from context, create nothing until the test's compilation failure confirms what's needed.
This includes adding 'just a new variant' of something that already exists: a new vehicle type, a new
rejection reason, a new value object field, or a new boundary value — even if similar ones already
exist in the codebase. Wait for the test's compilation failure before creating the new type.

The bar is a failing test, **not a failing test that already names the type**. For a last-row rule in
*When to Write Which*, the RED you already have is the one that authorizes the Domain type.

- Domain objects (policies, value objects, services) emerge from what the test demands
- Emergence decides WHEN a type appears, not WHERE. A test that only ever calls the handler can
  never force a Domain type into existence, so for a last-row rule write the handler as a call to
  the Domain type you wish existed, let that reference fail to compile, then create it
- Orchestrators coordinate; every rule past the simple-rule row of *When to Write Which* lives in
  the domain
- Real domain objects, never mocked

Placeholder test bodies are the same failure mode — see **Placeholder assertions are NOT wishful
thinking** above.

## Post-GREEN Wiring Verification (MANDATORY)

After the suite turns green and BEFORE commit:

1. Run `git diff --name-only`. Every production file the behavior required MUST appear in the diff.
2. If only test files changed but tests flipped RED → GREEN → you hit **Fixture Theater**: the test
   setup implements the feature. BLOCK the commit, go back to GREEN, write the production code.
3. Deletion test: mentally revert the production changes. If tests still pass, the test is exercising
   fixture state, not behavior.
4. Placement check: run `git diff --name-only`. If an Application file gained a rate, threshold, cap,
   or rounding computation and no Domain file was added or changed, the policy is in the orchestrator.
   BLOCK the commit and move it. Moving misplaced code is not the forbidden post-GREEN iteration: the
   acceptance test does not change and stays green throughout.

## Coverage and Mutation Gate

This skill owns **when** the gate runs and **what evidence closes it**. `skraft-quality-bar` owns
the numbers, and no setting lowers them.

Code you cannot cover is code no approved behavior asked for — delete it rather than lower the bar.

After both test streams are green and before merge, run the `mutation-testing` skill, which owns
the mechanics: what the run covers, how a surviving mutant is classified, and what happens to a
test that kills nothing.

Inside a cycle, mutate only what changed since the delivery started (the adapter's differential
mode): fast feedback, never evidence. The full coverage and mutation runs happen once, after the
story's last work commit, and only they close the gate.

The gate is closed when coverage and both mutation runs meet the bar and every survivor is
resolved. If the gate has not run, the work is not complete — that is sequence, and it holds for
every change.

## Walking Skeleton (first slice of a feature)

**ONE walking skeleton at a time.** A feature has several — `test-design-mandates` sizes them at
2–5, one per major flow variant, and picks each one's strategy (A/B/C/D) — but you drive one to GREEN
before starting the next. Two skeletons RED at once is the Concentric Circle ordering rule broken at
the skeleton level: two incomplete end-to-end paths, neither of them evidence.

This skill decides **in what order** you take them and what "done" means for one:

- Write ONE acceptance test proving end-to-end wiring with **real adapters** (filesystem, DB,
  subprocess, HTTP — fake only costly externals like paid APIs).
- Implement the thinnest possible slice: hardcoded values, minimal branching, no error handling
  beyond what the AT requires.
- Unit tests only if needed to decompose a complex GREEN.
- The AT drives ALL implementation. A later scenario's test may go green on its first run because an
  earlier skeleton already covered it — that is correct. Confirm it with the deletion test rather
  than assuming it.

## Concentric Circle Expansion

The double loop (acceptance + domain unit tests) is the inner circle. Once it is GREEN for a
behavior slice, expand outward — one circle at a time.

| Phase | What to write | Prerequisite |
|---|---|---|
| **1 — Inner (double loop)** | Acceptance test at the application boundary + domain unit tests | none — always first |
| **2 — API circle** | Integration test at the transport boundary (in-process host, real entry point) | Phase 1 GREEN |
| **3 — Infrastructure circle** | Integration test at the persistence / broker / external adapter boundary | Phase 2 GREEN |

**Ordering rule:** never start Phase N+1 while Phase N is RED. Expanding outward while the inner
loop is still RED hides the root cause under outer-circle complexity and produces untraceable
failures.

For test project placement and folder naming conventions, see `clean-architecture-testing`.

## One Acceptance Test at a Time

Every commit leaves the suite fully green — no `[Skip]`, no `[Ignore]`, nothing disabled
(`craft-discipline` C1, C2, C5). That rules out the common shortcut of authoring every acceptance
test up front and skipping all but one: a skipped test asserts nothing and carries a false green
through every commit until someone remembers to enable it.

Author acceptance tests **on demand**, one per slice:

1. The approved scenarios live in the `.feature` file. That is the backlog — it costs nothing and blocks nothing.
2. Write the executable acceptance test for **one** scenario. It is RED.
3. Drive it through the 4-phase cycle until green.
4. Commit — the whole suite is green, nothing is skipped.
5. Write the next scenario's acceptance test. Repeat.

A scenario whose test has not been written yet is not "skipped" — it is not started, and the
`.feature` file already records that it is owed.

## When Orchestrating Subagents (MANDATORY)

If you dispatch subagents to carry out a TDD slice — whatever the orchestration mechanism:

**NEVER put RED and SYNTHESIZE GREEN in the same subagent prompt.**

Split every TDD task into **two separate dispatches**:

1. **Dispatch 1 — RED only:** subagent writes the test, stubs to compile, runs to confirm behavior failure, reports the failing test output
2. **YOU inspect** — the RED output comes back to you. In an interactive session you show it to the developer and wait for explicit confirmation ("ok, proceed"); running autonomously you inspect it yourself. Either way it is inspected before GREEN is dispatched.
3. **Dispatch 2 — SYNTHESIZE GREEN:** only after that inspection

The inspection checkpoint is the **orchestrator's responsibility**. It cannot be delegated to the
subagent that will implement the result — that is the entire point of splitting the dispatch.

**You are violating this rule if** your subagent prompt contains both "write the failing test" AND
"implement the solution", or you wrote `PAUSE` in a plan comment but included all steps in one
prompt, or you assumed the developer would confirm via the plan document. Plans are documentation;
dispatch boundaries are enforcement. Subagents execute what they receive — split the prompt. And
efficiency that skips developer validation is not efficiency: one-shot dispatch is not a shortcut
worth taking.

## Anti-Patterns

- Strategic rules in orchestrators instead of domain
- Over-mocking that hides real business behavior
- Treating coverage as the quality signal — the bar is a floor, not evidence the tests assert
  anything; mutation score is the signal
- Duplicating acceptance test coverage with redundant domain tests

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---|---|
| Mocking domain objects in acceptance tests | Use real domain objects, mock only external boundaries |
| Designing domain objects upfront | Let domain emerge from test failures — don't design before testing |
| Treating compilation errors as RED | Stub to compile, then confirm failure on a business assertion |
| Placeholder assertion standing in for a real one | Call the API you wish existed; let the missing symbol fail the build |
| Committing when only test files changed | Post-GREEN verification via `git diff --name-only` |
| Modifying a failing test to pass | Iron Rule violation — fix the implementation or revert |
| Skipping the architectural guidance checkpoint | The failing test is inspected before any implementation is written |
| Writing every acceptance test up front and skipping all but one | Author one acceptance test per slice — a skipped test is a false green |
| Skipping Gherkin ("too small") | Even small features benefit from behavior-first thinking |
| Polluting Gherkin with class/endpoint names | Keep scenarios in business language only |
| Testing data structures directly by default | Test policies/rules; data types are covered by usage |
| Skipping the mutation gate before merge | Run the mutation-testing skill after tests green |

## Integration with other skills

`bdd-methodology` defines WHAT → this skill drives RED → inspection → SYNTHESIZE-GREEN →
`mutation-testing` validates test quality before merge → `craft-discipline` is the commit-time
self-check. See **What this skill owns** for the full delegation map, and pair with domain-specific
testing skills for patterns and examples.
